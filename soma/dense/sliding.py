"""Sliding-window dense encoding — ``window_size`` + ``overlap`` as a free knob.

The ``whole`` path (§5) feeds the full padded tile through the encoder in one
forward, interpolating the positional embeddings to the larger grid. That is one
end of a single mechanism; the other end is running the encoder over smaller
**windows** and stitching the per-window token grids. The reframing (design §5):
three sizes that are usually conflated —

* **native size** (e.g. 224) — sets the pos-embed table; not a hard input limit
  (``dynamic_img_size`` lets a ViT process a larger field at the correct mpp);
* **window size** ``W`` — how big a chunk goes through the ViT in one forward;
* **input size** — the padded ``encoded_size`` we want dense features for.

``whole`` is ``W >= input`` (one window, zero stitching); native sliding is
``W = 224``; the useful middle is ``W = 512`` slid over a larger input. So this is
**one** parametrized path, not a separate mode: :func:`encode_dense_sliding` takes
``window_size`` (``None`` ⇒ ``whole``) and ``overlap``, and the ``whole`` case falls
out as the degenerate single window — which we short-circuit to the exact same
``encode_tiles_dense(batch)`` call, so it stays **byte-identical** to the legacy path
(the parity anchor).

Stitching happens in **token space** (the grid the decoder/head consume), so the
output is always ``(B, d, grid_h, grid_w)`` for ``geometry.grid_shape`` regardless of
``window_size`` — sliding is purely internal to extraction. Windows and strides are
kept patch-aligned, so each window maps cleanly onto a block of tokens; overlapping
windows are blended with a separable raised-cosine importance map (the standard
frozen-backbone dense-inference recipe, cf. MONAI ``sliding_window_inference``) to
remove the block-boundary seams naive non-overlapping tiling would introduce.
